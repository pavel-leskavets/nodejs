#### If you want to encode or to decode text, you must write "node index" in the terminal, after that you must pass arguments
> For example: "node index -a encode -s 7 -i input.txt -o output.txt"
List of arguments: 
+ -a or --action (to set action type)
+ -s or --shift (to set shift number)
+ -i or --input (to set input file or filepath)
+ -o or --output (to set output file or filepath)

> If you forget to pass the required option you will see an error in the terminal  
If you passed all arguments, but input or output file doesn't exist you will see an error in terminal  
If you forget to pass input filepath you can write text directly in the terminal, and this text would be saved in output file  
If you forget to pass output filepath you will see decoded text directly in the terminal
